# Early steps to understanding Bayesian Deep Learning

**Probabilistic Programming** tries to represent probabilistic models as programs that generate samples. 

**Probabilistic Machine Learning** aims to represent uncertainty about predictions/models used. From which we can assess how uncertain the network is prediction is. 
A pratical example: Image diagnosis.

**Bayesian Neural Network** is a neural network with prior distribution on the weights.
